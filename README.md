my game database deliverable 4

#### For the first part of this deliverable, you can populate the database with python (once you have the DDL added).
To use the python autogeneration use it like so from the root directory of this file: 
`python3 main.py <length> <depth>` where `length` (default 5) is the number of rows to generate and `depth` (default 2) is the extra random numbers to add to tables that depend on other tables (foreign key testing).
An example could like like `python3 main.py 30, 10` or simply `python3 main.py`


To run mySQL on your system
    - mysql -u root -p
